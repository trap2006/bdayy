        <p>I love you so much more than you are capable of comprehending, and I am so proud of the beautiful girl you are today. You are kind, intelligent, hard-working, and beautiful, and you deserve all the good things that will come in your future. The younger version of you would be so proud to see how you are now, and you should carry her with you no matter how mature or grown-up you think you might be. I am always thinking of you, and I will always support you to become the best version of yourself. I love you, and I hope you have the best eighteenth!<br><br>Love, Daniel.</p>
